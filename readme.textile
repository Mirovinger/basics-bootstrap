Basics is a Wordpress theme based on the Roots theme, but stripped of most of the non-essentials. Currently based exclusively on Blueprint css. Uses less css (an scss implementation). 

The goal of this mini project is to give a barebones theme to developers that requires very little research and/or reading to get familiar with. The base CSS does not include any colors or images, seeing as this will always be specific to the theme that you are going to make.
